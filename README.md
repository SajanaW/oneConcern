# One Concern

## Emergency Preparedness Space
Key Players:
* **EOC** - city-level Emergency Operations Center. In charge of writing, maintaining, and drilling the Emergency Action Plan and public disaster preparedness education. Depending on funding, may or may not be staffed; if not fully staffed, title is usually passed onto a third party i.e. the fire department or public works department.
* **Civilian** - untrained ordinary citizen
* **CERT** - trained citizen in contact with the EOC; may be a sort of disaster preparedness ambassador and assist in small-scale rescue efforts
* **Community Organization** - local organizations by civilians with deep neighborhood-level connections to civilians including faith-based groups
* **OneConcern** - Bay-area startup that creates disaster simulation software for EOCs to train emergency responders with. Helps with resource allocation by displaying neighborhood-level data on demographics, etc. 

## Problem
Citizen preparedness is typically one of the most difficult / "art-form" and time-consuming activities of the EOC. Currently, many EOCs rely on town halls / outdated websites to disseminate disaster preparedness info. 

## Our Mission
We want to create digital tools that EOCs can disseminate that are engaging to civilians and establish a permanent 2-way communication channel with EOCs to facilitate neighborhood-EOC communication and partnership.
